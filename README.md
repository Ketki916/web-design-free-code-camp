2. Colored Markers: Contains an HTML page with a structure for three markers (red, green, blue) and CSS page to style the markers, using different color functions in CSS.
3. Registration Form: Contains an HTML page with a structure for a registration form grouped into three sections. First section asks user for first and last name, email, and a password (using text, email, and password input types to make sure that user gives a valid input). The second section asks the user if they are making a business or personal account (using radio buttons), and also asks them to click a checkbox to agree to the terms and conditions, which are linked (using checkbox input type). The third section asks the user for a profile picture (using file input type), their age (using number input type that allows a minimum and maximum age constraint to be set), how they found out about the website (using select element to create a dropdown menu), and a bio (using textarea element so that multiple lines can be typed). Finally, there is a submit button (using input type submit) to submit the form. There is also an attached CSS page to arrange and style the form elements.
