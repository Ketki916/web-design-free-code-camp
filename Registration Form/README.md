There are three sections in this form. First section asks user for first and last name, email, and a password 
(using text, email, and password input types to make sure that user gives a valid input). The second section asks 
the user if they are making a business or personal account (using radio buttons), and also asks them to click a 
checkbox to agree to the terms and conditions, which are linked (using checkbox input type). The third section asks 
the user for a profile picture (using file input type), their age (using number input type that allows a minimum and 
maximum age constraint to be set), how they found out about the website (using select element to create a dropdown 
menu), and a bio (using textarea element so that multiple lines can be typed). Finally, there is a submit button 
(using input type submit) to submit the form.
